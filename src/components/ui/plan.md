✦ Of course. You're on the right track, and it's a great goal to build a distributable
  component library modeled after shadcn/ui. This approach is powerful because it gives
  developers full control over the code in their own projects, rather than hiding it inside a
  versioned node_modules package.

  Let's break down how this system works. It's not a traditional API, but rather a clever
  combination of a CLI, a component registry, and raw file hosting.

  The Core Components

  There are three main parts to this system:

   1. The CLI Tool: This is the command-line interface that users will interact with (e.g., npx 
      my-cli init, npx my-cli add button). You'll publish this to npm.
   2. The Component Registry: This is a JSON file hosted somewhere publicly accessible (like on
      GitHub, Vercel, or a dedicated server). This file acts as the "database" for your CLI,
      telling it what components are available, what files they need, and what dependencies they
       have.
   3. The Component Source Code: These are the actual React component files (button.tsx,
      input.tsx, etc.) that you are building. They need to be hosted in a way that they can be
      downloaded directly, typically as raw files from a public GitHub repository.

  How It Works: A Step-by-Step Flow

  Let's imagine a user runs npx your-awesome-cli add button. Here’s what happens behind the
  scenes:

   1. Execute CLI: npx downloads and runs your CLI tool from the npm registry.
   2. Fetch Registry: The first thing your CLI does is make an HTTP request to fetch the
      registry.json file from its public URL.
   3. Find Component: The CLI parses the JSON and looks for an entry with the name "button".
   4. Process Component Info: It finds the "button" object in the registry. This object might
      look something like this:

    1     {
    2       "name": "button",
    3       "dependencies": ["class-variance-authority"],
    4       "files": [
    5         {
    6           "path": "components/ui/button.tsx",
    7           "url":
      "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-username/your-repo/main/src/components/ui
      /button.tsx"
    8         }
    9       ]
   10     }

   5. Fetch Component Files: The CLI sees it needs to download one file. It makes another HTTP
      request to the url specified for button.tsx.
   6. Write to Project: The CLI takes the raw content from the downloaded file and writes it to
      the user's local project at the specified path (e.g., ./components/ui/button.tsx).
   7. Install Dependencies: The CLI checks if the component has any dependencies. In this case,
      it's class-variance-authority. It then runs npm install class-variance-authority (or the
      equivalent for yarn/pnpm) in the user's project.
   8. Done: The component is now part of the user's codebase.

  The init Command

  The init command is similar but focused on bootstrapping the project:

   1. Ask Questions: It prompts the user for configuration details (e.g., "Where is your
      Tailwind config?", "Using TypeScript?").
   2. Modify Configs: It programmatically reads, modifies, and writes back to files like
      tailwind.config.js to add your library's themes, plugins, and animations.
   3. Install Core Dependencies: It installs packages that all components will need, like
      tailwindcss-animate, clsx, and tailwind-merge.
   4. Add Base Styles: It adds necessary base CSS styles to the user's global stylesheet (e.g.,
      index.css).

  How to Build This

   1. Structure Your Project: You'll need a new package for the CLI itself. A common approach
      is to create a packages/cli or a separate cli directory in your repository.
   2. Build the CLI:
       * Use a Node.js CLI framework like commander, yargs, or oclif to easily handle
         commands, arguments, and options.
       * Use a library like axios or the built-in fetch to download the registry and component
         files.
       * Use Node.js's fs module to write the files to the user's disk.
       * Use child_process to execute npm install commands.
   3. Create the Registry: Create the registry.json file. For now, you can just create it
      manually. As you add more components, you can write scripts to generate this file
      automatically by scanning your src/components directory.
   4. Host Everything:
       * Your component source code already lives in this GitHub repository. You just need the
         raw URLs.
       * You can host the registry.json file using GitHub Pages, Vercel, or even just by
         placing it in the public folder of a deployed website.
       * Publish the CLI tool to npm.

  This approach provides a fantastic developer experience and is a proven model.

  Does this explanation make sense? If so, we can start by building the basic structure for
  the CLI tool. Shall we proceed?
